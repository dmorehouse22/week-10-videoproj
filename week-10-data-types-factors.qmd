# Logicals

## Your Turn 1

Use `flights` to create `delayed`, a variable that displays whether a flight was delayed (`arr_delay > 0`).

Then, remove all rows that contain an NA in `delayed`. 

Finally, create a summary table that shows:

1. How many flights were delayed  
2. What proportion of flights were delayed

```{r}
flights |>
  ___________(delayed = arr_delay > 0) |>
  ___________(delayed) |>
  ___________(total = _____(delayed), 
              prop = _____(delayed))
```



# Factors

## Your Turn 2

Repeat the demonstration, some of whose code is below, to make a sensible graph of average TV consumption by marital status.

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_` before running the code)*

```{r}
gss_cat |>
  drop_na(________) |>
  group_by(________) |>
  summarise(_________________) |>
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = _______, 
                             y = _________________________))
```

## Your Turn 3

Do you think liberals or conservatives watch more TV?
Compute average tv hours by party ID an then plot the results.

```{r}

```



## Additional Modification

```{r}
gss_cat |>
  _______(tvhours) |>
  _______(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
                              "Republican, strong" = "Strong republican",
                              "Republican, weak" = "Not str republican",
                              "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
                              "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
                              "Democrat, weak" = "Not str democrat",
                              "Democrat, strong" = "Strong democrat")) |> 
  _______(partyid) |>
  _______(tv_avg = mean(tvhours)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = tv_avg, 
             y = fct_reorder(partyid, tv_avg))) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(y = "partyid")
```

```{r}
#levels(gss_cat$partyid)
gss_cat |>
  _______(tvhours) |>
  _______(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,
                                conservative = c("Strong republican", 
                                                 "Not str republican", 
                                                 "Ind,near rep"),
                                liberal = c("Strong democrat", 
                                            "Not str democrat", 
                                            "Ind,near dem"))) |> 
  ________(partyid) |>
  ________(tv_avg = mean(tvhours)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = tv_avg, 
             y = fct_reorder(partyid, tv_avg))) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(y = "partyid")

# Take Aways

Dplyr gives you three _general_ functions for manipulating data: `mutate()`, `summarise()`, and `group_by()`. Augment these with functions from the packages below, which focus on specific types of data.

Package   | Data Type
--------- | --------
stringr   | strings
forcats   | factors
hms       | times
lubridate | dates and times
